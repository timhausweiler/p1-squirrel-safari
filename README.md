# Project Overview

## Project Name

Squirrel Safari

## Project Description

This project will take users on a virtual Squirrel Safari/walk through Central Park by providing an interactive interface to the stories about squirrels collected during the [2018 Central Park Squirrel Census](https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com/). The application will interact with the [API provided by NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Stories/gfqj-f768) and will present a randomly selected observation upon loading. Users will then be able to load a new, randomly selected observation by clicking a "walk to the next squirrel"-button! The project will also correctly cite all the sources for the data presented. 

## API and Data Sample

The application will interact with the [API provided by NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Stories/gfqj-f768). The following is a sample of the data provided by the API.

```Json

[
  {
        "hectare": "42H",
        "shift": "PM",
        "date": "10142018",
        "note_squirrel_park_stories": "grey body, red head â€” exquisite. These two appeared to be engaging in a flirtatious yet combative ritual, ending up out of sight high up in a tree.",
        "story_topic_squirrel": true
  },    
]
```

### MVP/PostMVP

This project's MVP will
- fetch data from the API,
- render data from the API,
- randomly select one of the stories provided by the API,
- present the user information about when and where the observation was made and
- allow the user to load a new, randomly selected observation by clicking a button.

A post-MVP might
- allow users to search observations by one of the following keys: date, location or observation content,
- allow users to store favorite observations, and
- present those observations marked as favorites in a separate window.
